**Description**

This Final Project basically represents the idea that I had been working on previosuly through Amazon buisness. The title of the app is
**Danny Apparel** I always wanted to open up my own clothing store and therefore that was amy motication behind it. The app consisits of various types of activities,
fragments and models. Firestore was mainly used in the background to handle all the datatabse management. The app also furthurs make the user experience enhanced through the usage of
retrofit. In order to display the temperature I used OpenWeatherAPI.

**My struggle**
The app quickly got very complicated to debug, especially with using online database service. Recycler view was quite challenging to understand also
especially with adapter. Rest I think everything was pretty straitforward. The initial setup was difficult with firebase but once it was done rest was a
little easy to follow. The most difficult activity to create was cartActivity. With lots of interaction with firebase back and forth for instance if the user will be able to add items if the stock quantitiy is 0
Lots and lots of if conditions which made me go crazy quite many times. The whole interaction between activities is very complex even if the project itself doesnt look quite that big.
