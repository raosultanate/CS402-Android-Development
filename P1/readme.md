Description
The project simply shows my ability to be able to bring together several ideas about how several componenets of android development comes together as a whole to form a bigger picture. Some of the key things that I was able to incorportate into the android App was:
1) Using different views together and having them interact with differnt Layouts such as Contraint Layout and Frame Layout
2) Passing from One Activity to another using intent
3) Learning about the scope and functionalities of fragments
5) Making Fragments interact with the activitie using eventBus
6) Learned how to gain several permissions such as internet or Camera in the manifest file
7) How to request the OS to provide Camera service.
8) using Retrofit to interact with the online web service with a little bit of REST knowledge
9) Learned about different types of listener for example for the radioGroup 
10) Learned how to play around with GIF using a third party library that I had to import

Running it
In order to run the app the user simply needs to import the project to the androud studio and make sure to sync the libraries and also have a functioning simulator. Rest pretty much everything should be straight forward.

Some Hardships:
1) Understanding the eventBus was probably most challenging
2) Fixing regualr bugs in the program
3) understanding how Camera functionality works in the program

Testing
The app works great and was tested thoroughly.
