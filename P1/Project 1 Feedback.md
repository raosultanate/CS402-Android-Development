## Notes/Extras

All classes need to begin with an upper case letter.

Don't call classes POST, since that would be reserved for a POST method and could be confusing and not thought of as a class.

`firstFragment` is a bit vague, so make sure you're naming your classes correctly and clearly.

Navigation is a bit awkward but perfectly fine for project 1. You'll want to use common Android navigation on future projects.

Great job on customizing the UI. Everything looks great and this is a fun little app with a lot of different topics and features.
